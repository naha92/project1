# This is my website for Project 1 with a Django backend and using Bootstrap for the front end.
# This is my first commit
# To start this project I first needed to make sure that I had the necessary versions of python and pip installed. I did this by downloading the latest version of python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/ I then ran the command python -m ensurepip --upgrade to install pip on my machine. As I didn't have the permissions, I had to then run sudo python -m ensurepip --upgrade After this I needed to update the version of pip with python -m pip install --upgrade pip which again required me to run sudo python -m pip install --upgrade pip
